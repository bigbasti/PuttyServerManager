Putty Server Manager
====================
This is a small Tool i created for my collegues at work to help them manage all the PuTTY Session they are using.
(And they have A LOT of those...)

Another PuTTY-Tool? SRSLY?
==========================
I know that there are allready some PuTTY Tools out there like SuperPuTTY or PuTTY Connection Manager, but they didn't fullfil the demands.

Main Features
=============

Teamwork
--------
What is really different here is the ability to create a Session Repository for a Team.
So all team members can use predefied uptodate Sessions without caring to keeping them uptodate.

There is oly one Admin who adds Sessions and checks them in on a shared drive where everybody else has access to them.

USB-Stick Mode
--------------
Most PuTTY tools stode ther sessions in the Windows Registry, well that sucks, you can't take your sessions on a nother computer.
Putty Server Manager stores all his data in his directory so you can use this tool from a USB Stick or other removable media and easily share your sessions.

Other hady features
-------------------
After a while my collegues came up with some ideas for handy features like 
- atomatic colored PuTTY Windows so you can easily distinguish the Sessions (when you have lots of them opened)
- Automated tunneled Connections to servers with FileZilla / WinSCP

If you got some cool ideas for handy features just open an issue on GitHub.

Code
====
The Application is completely in english language, the Code documentation is in german... because of reasons! No seriously i donk know why maybe i will translate the code docs someday... maybe not ;)

This project has become some kind of a playground for me, since i am a web-dev and i usually don't write desktop apps don't wonder if you find some code which is not exactly "best practise".


If this App is interesting for you, don't bother to use it :)
